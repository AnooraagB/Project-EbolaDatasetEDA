# Ebola Outbreak Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 
The **Ebola Outbreak Dataset Analysis** project involves analysing a dataset containing the cumulative number of confirmed and probable Ebola cases and deaths during the outbreak in Western Africa from 2014 to 2016. The dataset used includes information from 10 countries across 3 years.

## Features

* Dataset with two attributes : cases and deaths for 10 countries over a period of 3 years.
* Visualisation of data using various libraries such as **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Pandas**.
* Analysis using bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to provide insights into the spread of Ebola.

## Concepts used
* **Data Handling with Pandas**:
  * **Pandas** library was used to display and manipulate the dataset, read from computer memory, and iterate through data as per the needs of the analysis.
* **Data Visualisation with Matplotlib**: 
  * **Matplotlib** was used to create various graphs and charts, including bar graphs and pie charts.
    * **Bar Graph**: Plotted **Country** as the x-axis and **Cases** as the y-axis for the first 100 rows, showing the largest number of cases in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea.
    * **Pie Chart**: Focused on data with cases greater than or equal to 500 to prevent label overlap, showcasing distribution of cases among countries.
* **Advanced Visualisation with Seaborn**:
  * **Seaborn** was used to plot two line graphs:
    * The first graph represents the complete dataset with **Country** as the x-axis and **Cases** as the y-axis, highlighting Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone as the most affected countries.
    * The second graph is a focused view of the first 20 rows, with **Country** as the x-axis and **Deaths** as the y-axis, showing Liberia had the highest number of deaths.

## Future plans
* Expand the dataset analysis to include additional countries and years.
* Implement more advanced visualisations and interactive charts.
* Suggestions for improvements and comments on the project are much appreciated.
